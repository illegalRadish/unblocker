# Transferred to SevenworksDev, this project wont be abandoned anymore.
# tProxy
Lightweight best web proxy for schools worldwide.
## What makes it different then others?
Other proxies use bare-server-node which requires NodeJS 18+ and most proxies don't work with Cyclic, Glitch, etc. Since this is lightweight, Installation and setup is super fast.
# Setup
## tProxy Setup (Hosting Service)
Import tProxy to one of these services: glitch.com or cyclic.sh (you will get banned if you use this on replit, i heavily dont reccomend importing this there)
## tProxy Setup (localhost + loca.lt tunnel)
Install NodeJS, Download tProxy, Open Command Prompt and navigate to the tProxy folder then run `npm i` then `npm start` or `node .` to start tProxy locally. If you want to tunnel your localhost to loca.lt so other users can access it. Run `npm i -g localtunnel` on windows/linux or `npm i localtunnel-termux` on android (termux).
